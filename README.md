# local-voice-assistant
A local voice assistant I'm working on using whisper / whisper-live and realtime-stt for realtime speech transcription, local LLM interfacing via Haystack, and realtime-tts for spoken responses. Some test files with speech transcription and wake work detection using openwakeword are available. Ensure all of the prerequisite libraries are installed.
